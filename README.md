# Elevate

This is a fun learning/art project that implements the Raft consensus algorithm to manage a fleet of elevators.

## Notes

Returning to this project after a long break.
I should rename the controller to control plane?
This should be less focused on Kubernetes specifically, but be a launching point for a general cloud-native workflow.
